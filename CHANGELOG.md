    "nautobot_circuit_maintenance": {
        "raw_notification_initial_days_since": 100,
        "raw_notification_size": 16384,
        "notification_sources": [
            {
              ...
            }
        ]
    }

## v0.2.5 - 2021-10-01

### Added

- #109: For Gmail API sources, add a new configuration item `limit_emails_with_not_header_from` to be used when the `source_header` is not `From` to limit the number of notifications received from a mailing list or alias.

### Fix

- #113: In `CircuitMaintenace` detail view, when the parsed notifications are listed, instead of using the date of the parsing action, we show the date when the original notification was sent.
- #118: Always create timezone-aware `parser_maintenance` timestamps.
- #123: Out-of-sequence notifications could make the final `CircuitMaintenance` state not reflect the latest notification state. Now, while out-of-sequence notifications will still be processed and linked to the `CircuitMaintenance` for context, they will not result in a change of its overall state.

## v0.2.4 - 2021-09-20

### Fix

- #108: Do not use the `IntegrityError` exception to avoid duplicating entries by verifying that the object exists before creating it.

## v0.2.3 - 2021-09-17

### Fix

- #104: When creating `RawNotification` we validate the `Integrity` exception from the DB to avoid postponing the error and handling it gracefully. Also, the `RawNotification.date` is now taken directly from the email notification `Date` instead of waiting for the parsing output, that will contain the same value in the `stamp` attribute.

## v0.2.2 - 2021-09-17

### Fix

- #100: Improve traceback formatting in case of exception during `process_raw_notification()`.

- #86, #88: Adopt new `circuit-maintenance-parser` to simplify email related code. Use `stamp` from notification to define the date of the `RawNotification`. Limit the size of the store `RawNotification` via configuration file.

### Fixed

- #76: Fix IMAP authentication logic that was not cleaning session after authentication failure.
- #85: Fix how the attach_all_providers feature was updated between restarts.

## v0.1.10 - 2021-09-01

## v0.1.9 - 2021-08-12

## v0.1.8 - 2021-08-12

### Added

- #51: Add a Custom Field in Provider, `provider_parser_circuit_maintenances` to allow custom mapping of the provider type class used from the `circuit-maintenance-parser` library.
- #54: Add a plugin option to define the number of days back to retrieve notifications on the first run of the plugin, before it has one previous notification as a reference.
- #63: Add a `attach_all_providers` flag in the `NotificationSource` plugin config to signal that any new Provider added will be automatically attached to the `NotificationSource`.

### Changed

- #51: Improve Development Environment and upgrade Nautobot version to 1.1.0

### Fixed

- #53: The **SINCE** filter to receive email notifications is extended on day in the past in order to get notifications from the same day as the last notifications stored.
- #61: Add rendering of `custom_fields` and `relationships` in all the detail_views of the plugin, `tags` in `PrimaryModel` detail view and the `export` action button on the object list views.
- #62: Fix Href from Circuit to related Circuit Maintenances.

## v0.1.7 - 2021-07-27

### Added

- #42:
  - Add stack trace to job log on exception
  - IMAP and GMail notification sources now support a `source_header` configuration parameter to allow for cases where `From` is not the relevant header to inspect.

### Fixed

- #42:
  - Avoid an exception if some Providers do not have a populated `emails_circuit_maintenance` value
  - `extract_email_source()` now correctly handles email addresses containing dash characters.
  - Avoid an exception on processing a non-multipart email payload
