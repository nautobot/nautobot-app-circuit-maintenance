# Changelog

## v0.2.5

### Added

- #109: For Gmail API sources, add a new configuration item `limit_emails_with_not_header_from` to be used when the `source_header` is not `From` to limit the number of notifications received from a mailing list or alias.

### Fix

- #113: In `CircuitMaintenace` detail view, when the parsed notifications are listed, instead of using the date of the parsing action, we show the date when the original notification was sent.
- #123: Unordered notifications made the final `CircuitMaintenance` state to not being the latest but the one from the last notification parsed. Now, only parsed notifications, newer than the latest one used to update the `CircuitMaintenace` are taken into account, but all of them are linked to it, to have a complete report of them, and be able to render all of them in descendant order in the detail view.

## v0.2.4 - 2021-09-20

### Fix

- #108: Do not use the `IntegrityError` exception to avoid duplicating entries by verifying that the object exists before creating it.

## v0.2.3 - 2021-09-17

### Fix

- #104: When creating `RawNotification` we validate the `Integrity` exception from the DB to avoid postponing the error and handling it gracefully. Also, the `RawNotification.date` is now taken directly from the email notification `Date` instead of waiting for the parsing output, that will contain the same value in the `stamp` attribute.

## v0.2.2 - 2021-09-17

### Fix

- #99: Change uniqueness for `RawNotification`.
- #100: Improve traceback formatting in case of exception during `process_raw_notification()`.

## v0.2.0 - 2021-09-15

### Added

- #86, #88: Adopt new `circuit-maintenance-parser` to simplify email related code. Use `stamp` from notification to define the date of the `RawNotification`. Limit the size of the store `RawNotification` via configuration file.

## v0.1.8 - 2021-08-12

### Added

- #54: Add a plugin option to define the number of days back to retrieve notifications on the first run of the plugin, before it has one previous notification as a reference.
- #63: Add a `attach_all_providers` flag in the `NotificationSource` plugin config to signal that any new Provider added will be automatically attached to the `NotificationSource`.

### Changed

- #51: Improve Development Environment and upgrade Nautobot version to 1.1.0

### Fixed

- #53: The **SINCE** filter to receive email notifications is extended on day in the past in order to get notifications from the same day as the last notifications stored.
- #61: Add rendering of `custom_fields` and `relationships` in all the detail_views of the plugin, `tags` in `PrimaryModel` detail view and the `export` action button on the object list views.
- #62: Fix Href from Circuit to related Circuit Maintenances.

### Added

- #42:

  - IMAP and GMail notification sources now support a `source_header` configuration parameter to allow for cases where `From` is not the relevant header to inspect.

### Fixed

  - `extract_email_source()` now correctly handles email addresses containing dash characters.
  - Avoid an exception on processing a non-multipart email payload
