# Installing the App in Nautobot

Here you will find detailed instructions on how to **install** and **configure** the App within your Nautobot environment.

## Prerequisites

- The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.2.0 and higher.
- Databases supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL


!!! note
    Please check the [dedicated page](compatibility_matrix.md) for a full compatibility matrix and the deprecation policy.

### Access Requirements

You will need access to an email account that receives provider maintenance notifications.

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Plugins can be installed manually or using Python's `pip`. See the [nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/plugins/#install-the-package) for more details. The pip package name for this plugin is [`nautobot-circuit-maintenance`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-circuit-maintenance/).

The plugin is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-circuit-maintenance
```

To ensure Circuit Maintenance is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-circuit-maintenance` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-circuit-maintenance >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_circuit_maintenance"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"nautobot_circuit_maintenance"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_circuit_maintenance"]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_circuit_maintenance": {
        "raw_notification_initial_days_since": 100,
        "raw_notification_size": 16384,
        "dashboard_n_days": 30,  # Defaults to 30 days in the configurations, change/override here
        "overlap_job_exclude_no_impact": False, # Exclude in job warnings the impact of `No-Impact`
        "notification_sources": [
            {
              ...
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```

## App Configuration

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings:

- `raw_notification_initial_days_since`: define how many days back the plugin will check for `RawNotification`s for each `NotificationSource`, in order to limit the number of notifications to be processed on the first run of the plugin. In subsequent runs, the last notification date will be used as the reference to limit. If not defined, it defaults to **7 days**.
- `raw_notification_size`: define how many bytes from a notification will be stored in the database to not store too big objects (maximum allowed is **16384** bytes). If not defined, it defaults to **8192** bytes.

The `notification_sources` have custom definition depending on the `Source` type, and are defined in the [General Usage](../user/app_use_cases.md#general-usage) section.
